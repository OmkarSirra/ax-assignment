Steps to achieve flask web app Deployment using Fargate Launchtype using Terraform
1. Create ECS Cluster using Launch type , Fargate.
2. Create ECS Service in the above cluster.
3. Add scale up and down policies to above ECS Service.
4. Create ALB , attach Target group to it with Ngnix port. 
5. Create ALB path based rules to route app based context path to Target group , which is pointed to ngnix container host port.
6. Ngnix container internally routes to flask web app container. 


How this works:
1. You dont have to explicitly add targets in target group of ALB.
2. AWS ECS service takes care of adding targets dynamically to the Target group based on desired count or Autoscaling policies setup.
